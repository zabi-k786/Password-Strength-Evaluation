## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Created multiple passwords** with variations in:
   - Length
   - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Inclusion of numbers and special characters

2. **Tested passwords** using [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/) and recorded their strength scores.

3. **Collected feedback** provided by the tool and analyzed which practices make passwords stronger.
